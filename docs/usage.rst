Sevivi (SEnsor VIdeo VIsualizer) has two modes of operation.
It can either work as a command-line tool, if you use supported input data, or you can use sevivi as a library,
instantiating the input data manually and improving the results by supplementing, for example, the algorithm used
to synchronize the sensors to the video.
